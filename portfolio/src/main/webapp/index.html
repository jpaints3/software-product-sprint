            <p>Hi everyone, nice to meet you! 
          My name is Josiah and I am a sophomore at Colgate. 
          Big mad scientist energy! XD</p>

            What is your background?<br>
                I've been in New York for practically all my life. I grew up in Yonkers, and then
                moved to New Rochelle in middle school. While in New Rochelle, I got into a program 
                called Prep for Prep and it was with the help of this program that I applied and got 
                into Phillips Exeter Academy. While at Exeter, I spent most of my time studying Latin 
                but sometime in my senior year, I decided to make a commitment to computer science, 
                and now here I am! :) <br> <br>
            What makes you you?<br>
                My family is Ghanaian, and I have grown up in Ghanaian communities all my life. It is 
                something that I take great pride in and I love to share about my community and culture
                when I can. I've been to Ghana to see my extended family and it felt like home as soon 
                as I touched the ground. Here are some of my favorite photos from my time there. 
            Who has been a role model in your life?<br>
                The biggest role models in my life have got to be the inventors of the past and the 
                cartoon/anime characters that I grew up watching. They have all influenced me to be 
                creative and the best me that I can possibly be. <br><br>

                To quote one of the wisest people of our generation: 
                "It's not about being the best. It's about being better than you were yesterday." -Naruto<br><br>
            What do you enjoy?<br>
                My favorite pastimes are playing chess and sports (mostly basketball) with my friends. 
                I think that there are many crossovers in terms of the skills that they both require and 
                they help me slow down to reflect on and appreciate the present moment.  <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Also I love photography, so please check out my portfolio if you have the time ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ</p>

            <p>I have a few group projects that I have worked on but these are my main personal projects.</p><br><br>
            <a href="http://blue-note5.herokuapp.com/"><img class="blueNoteImg" src="images/icons.png" style="height:25%; width:25%;"></a>
            <p class="blueNoteTxt">
                <br>
                One of my favorite projects is blueNote5. This is a project that combines social media websites as one 
                page. I'm hoping to turn it into an actual app that can save students lots of space on their phones.

            <a href="http://jpaintsil.colgate.domains/teachpage/"><img class="statsPageImg" src="images/stats icon.png" style="height:25%; width:25%;"></a>
            <p class="statsPageTxt">
                <br>
                Another one of my best projects is a statistics page that reads the text of students blogs and presents 
                statistics on the most popular topics.
